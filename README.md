# Deep-Learning-techniques-medical-images

This repository contains the report and code files as submitted for the final project of the MSc Data Science at Birkbeck University of London, September 2020.
It is my first work on deep learning and computer vision and a second improved version is under development.

<p>
<b>Title</b>: 
  Deep learning techniques applied to hybrid PET/MR medical images.
  
<b>Objective</b>:
  Application of deep learning methods on medical image analysis and classification for the identification of cases at risk of tumour development.
  
<b>Subject</b>: 
  Computer vision, medical images, convolutional neural network, binary classification.
  
<b>Data sources</b>:
  The medical images used for this project are part of the collection “Soft-tissue-Sarcoma” from The Cancer Image Archive (TCIA) (Clark et al., 2013), and the study “A 
radiomics model from joint FDG-PET and MRI texture features for the prediction of lung metastases in soft-tissue sarcomas of the extremities” (Vallières, et al. 2015). The Cancer 
Imaging Archive http://doi.org/10.7937/K9/TCIA.2015.7GO2GSKS 
See Appendix A of the Project report for how to download the DICOM dataset and clinical data using the two tcia_manifest files in the data_sources/tcia_manifest folder.
